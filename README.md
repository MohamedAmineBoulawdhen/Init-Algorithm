# Sentence Analyzer

A simple algorithm that analyzes a sentence character by character and determines:
1. The length of the sentence
2. The number of words in the sentence
3. The number of vowels in the sentence

## Requirements
- The sentence must end with a point (.) character
- Words in the sentence are separated by a single space
- Keep in mind that each character will be treated separately

## Usage
This algorithm can be used to quickly analyze any sentence and gather information about its length, number of words, and number of vowels.

## How it Works
1. Read the sentence character by character
2. Increment the length counter for each character
3. Increment the word counter if a space character is encountered
4. Increment the vowels counter if a vowel is encountered
5. The last character in the sentence is the point (.)
6. Output the length, number of words, and number of vowels

## Tips
- Use variables as counters to keep track of the length, number of words, and number of vowels
- Be mindful of edge cases and test your algorithm thoroughly

## Conclusion
With this algorithm, you can quickly and easily analyze any sentence and gather important information about its structure and content. Happy coding!
