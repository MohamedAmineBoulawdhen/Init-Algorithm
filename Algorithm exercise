/*Write an algorithm that read a sentence, which ends with a point, character by character, and to determine:
The length of the sentence (the number of characters).
The number of words in the sentence (assuming that the words are separated by a single space).
The number of vowels in the sentence.
You have to keep in mind that: 
Each character will be treated separately.
The last character is the point.
Use three variables as counters.*/
